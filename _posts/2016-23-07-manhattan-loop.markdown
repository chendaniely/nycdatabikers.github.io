Bike up the Greenway along the Hudson (all protected bike lane), take a detour to the<a href="https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=president+grand+tomb&find_loc=new+york&ns=1" target="_blank">General Grant Memorial</a> and see where President Grant is entombed above ground. July 23 is the anniversary of President Grant's death, so if you're lucky like us, you'll catch a reenactment:
