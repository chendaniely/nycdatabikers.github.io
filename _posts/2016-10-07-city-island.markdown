# Highlights: Little Italy Bronx, Orchard Beach, Zoma



## The ride

<iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='https://www.strava.com/activities/637056561/embed/7f9a1a13e242f2eadc317e5f1f13dbc4a50fd5a7'></iframe>

Bike up the east Manhattan, cross the Macombs Dam Bridge into the Bronx, east to Pelham Bay and into City Island. You can't access the beach from City Island, because it's mostly private property, so you have to bike roughly 10-15 min over to Orchard Beach. 

## Food stops

1. First pizza stop at <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/trattoria-zero-otto-nove-new-york-8" target="_blank">Trattoria Zero Otto Nove</a>, Whole pies only, but their pies are relatively small:

3. We were pretty full by the time we got to City Island, so just ice cream on the island at <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/lickety-split-ice-cream-bronx" target="_blank">Lickity Split</a>. The ice cream is normal, just Breyer's, but it's charming:
